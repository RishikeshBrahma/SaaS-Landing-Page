‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

MySQL Server

Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/rishikeshbrahma/saas-landing-page.git
cd saas-landing-page

Create and activate a virtual environment

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your local database

Make sure your local MySQL server is running.

Create a database (e.g., saas_landing).

Update the database credentials in config.py to match your local setup.

Run the application

python app.py

The application will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

üöÄ Deployment to Render
This application is deployed on Render using a Gunicorn server and an external MySQL database hosted on Aiven.

1. Prepare for Production
WSGI Server: Ensure gunicorn is in your requirements.txt file.

Entry Point: Create a wsgi.py file in your root directory:

from app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

Database Port: Modify app.py to accept the port as a separate environment variable.

# app.py
import os

db_pool = mysql.connector.pooling.MySQLConnectionPool(
    # ... other settings
    port=os.environ.get('MYSQL_PORT'),
    # ... other settings
)

2. Set up an External Database
Since Render no longer offers a free MySQL tier, you can use a free external database from a provider like Aiven or Free MySQL Hosting.

Create a free MySQL database on your chosen platform.

Gather the connection details: Host, Port, Database Name, User, and Password.

3. Deploy on Render
Create a New Web Service on Render and connect it to your GitHub repository.

Configure the Settings:

Runtime: Python 3

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn wsgi:app

Add Environment Variables: In the "Environment" tab, add the following variables using the credentials from your external database.

Key

Value

PYTHON_VERSION

3.11.0 (or your desired version)

SECRET_KEY

Your own long, random, secret string

MYSQL_HOST

The hostname from your database provider

MYSQL_PORT

The port number from your database provider

MYSQL_DB

The database name from your database provider

MYSQL_USER

The username from your database provider

MYSQL_PASSWORD

The password from your database provider

Deploy: Save your changes and trigger a manual deployment. Render will build and launch your application.
